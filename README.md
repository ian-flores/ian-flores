### 🔭 I’m currently working on:

#### [Finding Errors in Data Analyses](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/06/finding-errors-in-data-analyses/)

> This is a research project focusing on how and how well data scientists and data science students identify errors in data analyses. In particular, we want to explore how the ability to catch errors varies by level of experience as well as familiarity to the data and type of analysis. 

#### [Glosario](https://github.com/carpentries/glosario) 📦

> `glosario` is an open source glossary of terms used in data science that is available online and also as a library in both R and Python. By adding glossary keys to a lesson's metadata, authors can indicate what the lesson teaches, what learners ought to know before they start, and where they can go to find that knowledge. Authors can also use the library's functions to insert consistent hyperlinks for terms and definitions in their lessons in any of several (human) languages.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning about:

#### - [Data Engineering on Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer)


#### - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

#### - [JS Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
