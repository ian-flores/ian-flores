I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Voltron Data. I specialize in implementing mainly cloud-based solutions to support workloads ranging from CI/CD to Security & Monitoring. I am also interested in optimizing cloud financial spending and am a FinOps Certified Practitioner. In addition to this, I have a knack for filesystems and have explored everything from NFS to WekaFS. Furthermore, I have previous experience working across multiple regulated industries accomplishing effective solutions to improve data science workflows, and I possess a Master of Data Science from the University of British Columbia. Outside work, I am a certified free diver; I love to surf and travel Latin America.
